nexusDescription="[size=3]Having been inspired by\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/7511756]Manan6619's[/url]\xfeff wonderful mod\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67794]DUST Tweaks - Better Repair and More[/url]\xfeff, I decided to make\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/57927]DUST[/url]\xa0\x61 lot less buggy and easier to play with. Firstly, thanks to Manan for graciously giving me permission to use some of his changes in my mod.\n<br />Here's what I managed to fix and tweak to my liking:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Ported over a lot, and I mean a lot, of YUP and WMIM changes. A lot of them were reorienting clipping/misaligned objects, but I included a lot of other random miscellaneous\xa0\x63hanges, including adding NCR dogtags to relevant NPCs[/size]\n<br />[/list][/size]\n<br />[size=4][b][color=#e69138]Locations[/color]\n<br />[/b][/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Renamed a lot of locations, including interiors, to match the DUST lore/naming conventions. This includes renaming Prospector Camps to Survivor Camps, renaming Goodsprings Source to Ghost Town Dustbowl, renaming Ranger Station Foxtrot to Survivor Camp, and renaming Nelson, Nipton, and Goodsprings interiors to match their renamed location counterparts[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Disabled location-based triggers for Lonesome Road quests[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Added/removed reputation markers from certain locations[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Changed rigged mailbox outside one of the starting locations to be a normal mailbox[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Made Vault 22 Elevator inaccessible[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Fixed the Big MT showing the Lonesome Road map[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />[/size][b][size=4][color=#e69138]Misc.[/color]\n<br />[/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Bedroll kits now work (integrated YUP fix that fixed bedroll kit effect if there are multiple ones loaded in the same cell)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Renamed a few random items that ruined lore, including Red Lucy's Bed, Wins' Safe, and a few keys[/size]\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Disabled the rest of the REPCONN Test Site intercoms[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Removed a bunch of useless keys from NPC inventories (such as Freeside House Key), as well as unlocking doors that were missing keys (such as The King's door). I also opted to add a lock the REPCONN Test Site hatch so it wasn't always inaccessible[/size]\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Changed some loading screens to better match DUST lore[/size]\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Updated the Threatening Note in the El Rey Motel to be more lore-friendly[/size]\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Removed Anderson's Confession from the Cloud Victim's inventory[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Replaced all instances of mantis oothecae with ant egg clutches[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]The Broken Solar Panels at Nellis no longer give EXP[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Edited/hid GRA challenges to better fit lore[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Fixed Experimental Rad-X/Rad-Away to incorporate YUP fixes for duration[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Updated a bunch of formlists with DUST-added content, including repair lists, challenge lists, and perk lists[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Edited a bunch of notes (mostly double spaces and trailing whitespaces)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Restored Forlorn Hope Journal 8 and\xa0Journal Page on Quarryville cannibal[/size]\n<br />[/list][/size]\n<br />[b][size=4][color=#e69138]NPCs[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/b][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Renamed a few random NPCs to follow naming conventions, such as renaming Wastelanders to Survivors[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Removed a bunch of scripts from NPCs so that they don't fail quests or make weird pop-up messages[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Removed Tribals from the smoking faction so they don't smoke in their idle animations[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Removed track crime flag from the rest of the factions (since DUST removed most of them)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Deleved more NPC and creature leveled lists (since DUST deleveled them)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Made Ghoul body parts take more damage (1/10th of incoming damage instead of 1/100th). It's still mostly useless, but at least crippling the limbs feels like it does more[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Made REPCONN cannibals not have Ghoul voices[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Removed NCR Dogtag from the King's Remnant in Boulder City[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Fixed an un-cannibalized Quarry Worker[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Stopped Gomorrah Cloud Victims from dropping prostitute outfits[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Fixed the factions for the cannibals at Hill Town (still had a lot of NCR-related factions), as well as removing NCR dog tags from their inventories[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Fixed the sizes of NCR rangers at Nellis[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Fixed Tech Scavenger voices[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Added Jar of Cloud Residue to leveled lists so that you can actually craft the Sierra Madre Martini[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />[/size][b][size=4][color=#e69138]Weapons and Ammo[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/b][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Fixed sawed-off shotgun raider leveled list so it's not empty[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Added Cowboy Carbine to WithAmmoCowboyCarbine, instead of the Cowboy Repeater[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Knife Spear/Knife Spear Clean recipes use wood instead of Throwing Knife Spear/Knife Spear[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Made a Throwing Knife Spear recipe (uses Cosmic Knife or Knife and wood, can be crafted with Portable Crafting Kit)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Updated a bunch of weapon repair lists to incorporate unique version of weapons that were made un-unique[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Created repair lists for a lot of DUST-added weapons so they can be repaired by themselves[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Corrected weapon class/damage resistances for DUST-added weapons[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Tweaked both versions of Makeshift Flamer (player-craftable version can scare abominations, loot-only version renamed Hand-Crafted Flamer)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Fixed/added drained ammo/ammo cases to DUST-added weapon lists[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Henry 1860 Repeater can now be looted with its weapon mod[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Stopped laser pistols from sometimes dropping 10mm pistol mods[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Fixed Ammo22375 using .22LR ammo instead of .223 ammo[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Increased skill requirements for a few ammo crafting recipes (from 25 -&gt; 35 and 10 -&gt; 15) to better match other DUST-changed recipes[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]All .45 auto recipes are now available from the start, and I added a .45 auto junk rounds recipe[/size]\n<br />[/list][/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]All weapons with weapons mods now have a chance to spawn with them (DUST started this process, but missed quite a few weapons)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Finished junk round integration (DUST started this process, but missed quite a few ammo variants)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Junk rounds can now be crafted with the Portable Crafting Kit[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Removed mods from Makeshift Incinerator and Makeshift Minigun (it would change their models to be completely different weapons)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Restored a bunch of weapon mods for makeshift weapons, and properly integrated them into the Wasteland[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]These mods are: Makeshift Assault Rifle Silencer, Makeshift Plasma Rifle Scope, Makeshift Submachine Gun Recoil Compensator, Makeshift Rifle Scope, Makeshift Pistol Extended Magazine, Makeshift Pistol Compressor (extra damage), Pipe Rifle Scope, and Pipe Rifle Silencer[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Mods have been added to all variants of Makeshift Pistol/Pipe Rifle, and the Dust Musket uses the Pipe Rifle mods[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Added recipe for Makeshift Pistol/Pipe Rifle mods, since those weapons are craftable[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Pipe Rifle Scope: 1 milk bottle, 1 camera, and 1 wonderglue[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Pipe Rifle Silencer: 1 dirty water and 1 wonderglue (can also be crafted with irradiated or purified water if it's in your inventory)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Makeshift Pistol Extended Magazine: 1 fission battery and 1 wonderglue[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Makeshift Pistol Compressor: 1 jet, 1 scrap metal, 1 wonderglue, and 1 turpentine[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Added a challenge based on how much damage you do with makeshift weapons[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />[/size][b][size=4][color=#e69138]Armor[/color]\n<br />[/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Balanced NCR Trooper armor variants, such as NCR Trooper Fatigues, to match DUST rebalances[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Integrated Armored Radiation Suit, Reinforced into leveled lists (it was converted but never integrated)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Changed Survivor at Ranger Station Delta to use an Armored Radiation Suit, Reinforced instead of an Armored Radiation Suit[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Renamed Followers' doctor coat to doctor's coat and Desert Ranger Combat Armor to Worn Riot Armor[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[color=#e69138][size=4][b]Perks[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Deleveled a few perks, and balanced them so they have downsides like DUST perks[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Concentrated Fire makes you also take +5% limb damage[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Chemist has your addiction rate increase by +25%[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Nerves of Steel increases AP usage by +10%[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Center of Mass makes you do -15% limb damage to all other limbs in VATS[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Chem Resistant makes addictions last +50% longer[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Hid Ferocious Loyalty and Spray and Pray, as there aren't any companions in DUST[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Updated Fight the Power! formlist so it only affects NCR armor, as well as adding the new NCR armor to the list[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=3]I also have an optional file that adds some small tweaks for the DUST Pre-Order Fixer (which I recommend using). Currently it just forwards YUP fixes and fixes some small typos. I also have a small patch for CPI users which makes the pipe rifle mods utilize a water bottle and milk bottle icon for the silencer and scope mods respectively. This mod requires YUP and Manan's DUST Tweaks. WMIM is technically not required, but a lot of my fixes will not make sense without using it, especially the recipe for .45 junk rounds.\n<br />\n<br />Currently I am unable to fully load Vault 22 in GECK. Because of that, I was unable to properly orient the ant egg clutches there. Apologies if there's any clipping or floating because of it.\n<br />\n<br />Your load order should be something like this:\n<br />Fallout\n<br />[DLCs]\n<br />...\n<br />YUP\n<br />WMIM\n<br />...\n<br />DUST\n<br />[DUST Pre-Order Fixer]\n<br />...\n<br />DUST Tweaks\n<br />...\n<br />DUSTed DUST\n<br />[DUSTed DUST Pre-Order Fixer]\n<br />...\n<br />\n<br />Check the articles tab to see any known bug fixes/tweaks that I may implement in the future.\n<br />\n<br />Please check the credits section for all of the modders whose resources were used in DUST.[/size]"
