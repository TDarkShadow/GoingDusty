nexusDescription="[b]What this is:\n<br />[/b]The culmination of years and over a thousand mesh fixes, originally for inclusion in Tale of Two Wastelands.\n<br />\n<br />[b]What this does:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Reduces draw calls\n<br />[*]Reduces triangle count when applicable\n<br />[*]Reduces vertex count when applicable\n<br />[*]Improves frame rate\n<br />[*]Fixes shader flags (alpha, environment mapping, environment mapping fade)\n<br />[*]Fixes smoothing\n<br />[*]Fixes wonky UVs\n<br />[*]Fixes incorrect vertex colors\n<br />[*]Fixes broken animations in some static objects\n<br />[*]Removes useless extra data\n<br />[*]Removes useless animation data\n<br />[*]Fixes collision alignment\n<br />[*]Fixes collision materials to correct bullet decals and sounds\n<br />[*]Fixes collision on cell kit pieces to be more accurate where it will not cause any issues\n<br />[*]Fixes collision on static pieces to be more accurate where it will not cause any issues\n<br />[*]Fixes degenerate normals (a UV issue that causes weird lighting issues)\n<br />[*]Fixes exactly one texture's transparency and adds proper LOD textures to a mesh\n<br />[/list][b]What this [color=#ff0000]doesn't[/color] do:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Fix armor meshes (there are some but this is a big future project)\n<br />[*]Fix weapon meshes (Use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/65052]WMIM[/url]\xfeff)\n<br />[*]Fix animations\n<br />[*]Make collisions more complex (too many incompatibilities and heavier on the engine)\n<br />[*]Make collisions smaller to allow close item stacking (the bigger collision is on purpose to prevent bugs)\n<br />[*][s]Anything that would require a plugin (this will change when hats are sorted out)[/s]\n<br />[*]Any meshes that are exclusive to Fallout 3 (These are in Updated Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch)\n<br />[/list][b]\n<br />Installation:\n<br />[/b]Use your favorite mod manager, or manually extract the files.\n<br />Have these files load after [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/51664]YUP[/url] (or any other bug fix that contains meshes) and before the rest of your mods.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Uninstallation:[/b]\n<br />Use your mod manager's method of uninstalling mods, or delete the meshes folder if you installed it manually and hope none of your other mods used meshes. Please use a mod manager.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Requirements:[/b]\n<br />The base game. DLC fixes are included but not required for the fixes to work.\n<br />\n<br />[b]EXTREMELY RECOMMENDED:\n<br />[/b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/81766]Michael Angelo's Workshop Windows Restored[/url]\xfeff, because TheKraken unintentionally fixed an issue that I couldn't, and also corrected a vanilla oversight that I missed. Will be merged in with the next update with his permission.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Incompatibilities:\n<br />[/b]None? Just make sure mesh replacers overwrite these.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Tale of Two Wastelands:\n<br />[/b]After 3.3 I'll try to maintain an optional file that only includes meshes not included with 3.3.\n<br />Currently works with TTW, it'll just become redundant with 3.3 (that means uninstall it when you update, then keep an eye out for the future updates).\n<br />\n<br />[b]Bug Reporting:\n<br />[/b]Use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66347]Stewie's Tweaks[/url] with \"bMeshPath = 1\", open the console with \"~\", click on the mesh, and take a screenshot, and include that in your bug report."
