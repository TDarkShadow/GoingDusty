nexusDescription="[size=4][quote]\xfeffI noticed my mod has been featured on Sinitar's \"ULTIMATE\" mod list.\n<br />For those of you who are currently following it, I urge you to read\xa0[url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F1-6lF8dI4i2Zz8iT-bv_Ci1VO9MSU4MiSUrT5JqgHA/edit]this essay[/url]\xa0\x62y forever_phoenix.\xfeff\n<br />\n<br />I also recommend you follow [url=https://vivanewvegas.github.io/]Viva New Vegas[/url]\xfeff or [url=https://github.com/Sigourn/newvegassharp/]S#ARP[/url]\xfeff.\xa0You deserve an easier and more stable mod list by authors who do not berate you when asking for support.[/quote][/size]\n<br />[size=3][i]Description[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Elijah's voice through holograms sucks. Majorly. This attempts to fix that.\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]The practically essential [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277]JIP LN NVSE Plugin[/url]\xfeff mod adds distortion to a lot of extra sound emitters in the game, like holotapes and tannoys. This bugs out when peak frequencies are too high. To fix that, I ran a sweep through all of Elijah's voice files and lowered to a certain threshold.\n<br />\n<br />It's a hack, and it makes certain lines quieter, but it's a decent tradeoff in my opinion.[/size][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]These files are for the English version. If you're having issues in another language, please let me know and I'll patch those files too.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=3]Installation[/size][/i]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Install through a mod manager of your choice - preferably Mod Organizer 2.\n<br />\n<br />Unless you're using the OGG version (read the FAQ if you don't know which one to use), I recommend pairing this with\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/65854]BSA Decompressor[/url].\n<br />If you're following [url=https://vivanewvegas.github.io/]Viva New Vegas[/url], which you probably should be, you should already have ran it.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=3]Compatibility[/size][/i]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]This mod should be fine with any other mod that doesn't affect Elijah's vanilla voice lines. If a mod does, let it overwrite this mod, however those lines will sound borked again.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][i]FAQ\n<br />[/i][/size][size=2]\n<br />[size=2]Q: Why use this over setting [url=https://geckwiki.com/index.php?title=SetOptionalPatch]bVoiceModulationFix[/url]=0?\n<br />A: Disabling bVoiceModulationFix[/size] means holotapes and certain other activators won't have any distortion.\n<br />\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 This mod remains as a happy medium. You get your distortion [i]and[/i] your ears don't bleed when Elijah speaks.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Why is the WAV version so much larger?\n<br />A: WAV files cannot be compressed, while OGG files can.\n<br />\n<br />Q: So which version should I use?\n<br />A: As long as you have the space, you should download the WAV version. Gamebryo struggles with OGG files for some reason.\n<br />\xa0 \xa0 Feel free to try the OGG version if you like, but I can't tell you what bugs you'll get.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Can I install this mid-game?\n<br />A: You can! It's just an audio replacer with no plugins or scripts. You can also remove it mid-game if you wanted!\n<br />\n<br />Q: I installed it and the audio sounds much quieter!\n<br />A: Please read my pinned comment as to why it's like that. They will be fixed in a future update.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][i][size=3]Permissions[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[/i][size=2]Do whatever you like with these. They're just less-bad vanilla audio files. Use them for YouTube skits, make weird smutty videos with them for Rule34, I couldn't care less.[/size]"
