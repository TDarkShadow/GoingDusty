nexusDescription="If you like this mod please consider endorsing it, It will help get this mod found in Nexus search results so that word is spread of it's existence.\n<br />\n<br />If you want faster support/answers from me feel free to join the\xa0xNVSE Discord:\xa0https://discord.com/invite/EebN93s and look for my mod under the \"forum\" section.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Features:[/b]\n<br />Compatible with most mods that edit navmeshes.\n<br />Better pathing, seeks to eliminate NPCs walking into walls and other objects.\n<br />More competitive AI, more cover for NPCs to use and better navigation for melee attackers so they don't take long paths to get to you.\n<br />Fixes vanilla game navmesh errors.\n<br />Fixes sunken nodes which can lead to NPCs being stuck in the ground.\n<br />Fixes unfinalized cells and mismatched borders that prevent NPCs from navigating.\n<br />Optimized vanilla navmeshes for performance.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility:[/b]\n<br />To use this mod with other mods that alter navmeshes or add load doors (Doors that cause a loading screen) to vanilla game areas read the guide below, using this mod with other mods without following the guide may lead to game instability or glitches. [b]DO NOT[/b]\xa0use \"Navmesh Fixes and Improvements\" or other mods that try to fix vanilla game navmeshes with this mod, they will be redundant with this mod as it supersedes them.\n<br />For people who do not use any mods that alter the vanilla game landscape or add new interiors then the rest of this guide can safely be ignored.\n<br />\n<br />The following steps will show you how to use this mod properly with most mods that alter the vanilla landscape and is meant to be easy to follow even for casual players: [b]WARNING:[/b]\xa0It's important\xa0you read the mod list at the bottom of the page and set load order [b]BEFORE[/b]\xa0the patch creation process (Load order tells the GECK how to generate the patch) you can rearrange your load order after you are done.\n<br />\n<br />This guide is heavily recommended to be used even if you don't use this mod but use multiple other mods that alter navmeshes, as using multiple mods with extensive navmesh edits can lead to broken ai or crashes.\n<br />\n<br />Here is an easy to follow video tutorial if you are having trouble with the guide:\xa0\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]lWUWDQxFM2E[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />Step 1:\xa0\x44ownload and install the \"Blank Compatibility Patch\" in the \"Optional\" section of this mods files on Nexus.\n<br />Step 2:\xa0Put the blank mod you downloaded as low as you can in your load order in Mod Organizer.\n<br />Step 3:\xa0\x44isable \"Ultimate Edition ESM Fixes\" if you have it installed (You can reenable the mod later after patching, failing to do so will causes crashes in game)\xa0\n<br />Step 4:\xa0\x44ownload the NV\xa0[url=https://geckwiki.com/index.php/Garden_of_Eden_Creation_Kit]GECK[/url]\xa0\x66rom Steam(included with GoG version by default) and\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/64888]GECK Extender[/url]\xa0(Download BOTH main Geck Extender files on Nexus) and\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67883]xNVSE[/url]\xa0(If you already installed xNVSE for use with other mods then no need to download it again).\n<br />Step 5: Go into the Mod Organizer ini editor and open \"GeckCustom.ini\"\xa0In the \"General\" section of the ini set\xa0\x62\x41llowMultipleMasterLoads=1 and then save and close the ini. (You may need to add the lines yourself).\n<br />Step 6:\xa0Launch the GECK (Construction Kit) through Mod Organizer and ensure it says \"GECK Extender\" at the top of the program window, if not \n<br />then repeat step 4.\n<br />Step 7: In that data window that appears check the box by double clicking the main mod and also check EVERY ESM (Main game DLCs and mods) And after that\xa0select \"MyNavmeshCompatibilityPatch\"\xa0\x61nd click \"Set as active file\".\n<br />Step 8:\xa0\x42\x65 sure the top of the GECK window shows \"My Navmesh Compatibility patch\" as the main file, if it does not or has the name of some other file then close the GECK without saving and repeat step 7.\n<br />Step 9:\xa0\x41\x66ter the GECK is finished loading, click on \"Navmesh\" at the very top of the GECK and select \"Force Finalize All Spaces\" and wait. The GECK window will likely say \"Not Responding\" but\xa0[b]DO NOT[/b]\xa0\x63lose the window and just wait patiently. (This process for most modern systems will take about 10 to 20 minutes and even up to an hour for weaker hardware or for a large numbers of mods).\n<br />Step 10: Save the plugin and close the GECK. Be sure the plugin is active and below all other ESMs and have fun enjoying the game.\n<br />\n<br />[b]TIP:[/b]\xa0Load order can be changed after the patch is generated (Mod load order matters for the GECK), for example YUP loads after my mod but might end up loading after some mod that conflicts with YUP that is supposed to load before my mod, in such case you can change the load order around after the patch is generated as long as the patch is loaded as low as possible in your load order.\n<br />\n<br />[b]TIP 2: [/b]To find out if mods you have need to be added to the patch creation process you can load all your mods in xEDIT right click and apply a filter and check \"By record signature\" and \"Navigation Mesh\". Also you can consult the lists down below for mods you may have in your load order.\n<br />\n<br />[b]WARNING:[/b]\xa0Load order must be set before the patch creation process, failing to do so may result in improper changes being applied.\n<br />\n<br />[b]WARNING 2:[/b]\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/77170]Ultimate Edition ESM Fixes[/url]\xa0[b]MUST[/b]\xa0\x62\x65 disabled before creating a patch (For TTW use MO2 to hide all of the TTW NV ESMs in the filetree tab), will cause in game crashes if a patch is generated with it enabled.\xa0(You can reenable the ESMs later after patching)\n<br />\n<br />[b]WARNING 3:[/b]\xa0The patch must be regenerated every time you update this mod to a new version and always from a\xa0\x63lean ESM file. A clean file should also be used any time you need to regenerate the patch.\n<br />\n<br />[b]WARNING 4:[/b]\xa0\x44o not generate and use more than one patch at a time (This includes my progenerated YUP patch and the VNV navmesh patch) , all mods that add load doors and navmeshes to vanilla worldspaces should be loaded at the same time in the GECK.\n<br />\n<br />[b]WARNING 5: [/b]If you are using mods that alter navmeshes that are an ESP that is [b]NOT [/b]flagged as an ESM in xEDIT then it is highly recommended you uninstall and stop using said mods or contact the mod author and tell them to make the ESP an ESM. Mods that do this will cause severe pathfinding issues and game breaking glitches.\n<br />\n<br />[b]WARNING 6:[/b]\xa0\x44on't load any ESPs in the GECK while generating patches.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />The following lists will help you determine what mods in your load order need to be included in the patch creation process and what the load order should be in Mod Organizer with this mod.
