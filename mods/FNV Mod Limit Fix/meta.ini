It works with MO2.\n<br />[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff8f00][size=5][u]Conflicts[/u][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]This fix should have no conflicts whatsoever.\xa0\x41 mod limit message might appear. It will happen if you use\xa0JIP's Companions Command and Control mod.\xa0There is nothing I can do about the message for now. When the mod author returns from his busy schedule I will let him know about what has happened and I'm certain he will patch it. It in no way means that the plugin does not work or that the limit still exists.\n<br />[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff8f00][size=5][u]Why the Limit Existed[/u][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]The plugin limit bug existed because the game opens 3 file handles for each plugin and never seems to close them. The reason as to why it does this is still unknown. The game has a hard coded limit of 512 maximum file handles that can be opened at once. When loading anywhere around 140 plugins, the game requires around 420 handles for these alone. Along with bsa files as well as normal files the game requires, the game would easily attempt to open more than 512 handles. This is the reason assets stopped loading and things would begin to go south.\n<br />[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff8f00][size=5][u]How this Fix Works[/u][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]\xa0This fix simply bumps the maximum number of file handles up to 2048. The reason that 2048 is used is because it is the maximum number of file handles that Windows usually allows, and the more the merrier.\xa0The fix also redesigns the way the game obtains file handles. Due to the file handles not closing, the game would have iterate over all of the loaded plugin handles in order to open a new one. This fix changes this and allows for file handles to be opened instantly.\n<br />[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff8f00][size=5][u]Performance Boost[/u][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]The increase in fps, stutter removal and decreased loading times seems to affect everyone to a different extent. This mod can only have positive performance benefits and will in no way affect any of the game's content. The only way to know if it will benefit you is to download it and try it for yourself.\n<br />[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff8f00][size=5][u]Thanks[/u][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]Thank you to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/7481963][color=#3c78d8]RoyBatty[/color]\xfeff\xfeff[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/2232669][color=#3c78d8]lStewieAl\xfeff[/color]\xfeff[/url] for helping me along the way.\n<br />[/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]Thank you to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/2232669][color=#3c78d8]lStewieAl\xfeff[/color]\xfeff[/url] for gifting me Premium.
