nexusDescription="[size=4]Description[/size]\n<br />[size=2]Fixes a save bloating issue related to actors detecting the player, improving save/load speed and decreasing save size 10-30% depending on playthrough length.\n<br />Fully compatible with both vanilla and modded game saves. To bulk remove the bloat from existing saves (even if you no longer have the mods the save was created with) use the\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/80833/]ActorCause Save Debloater[/url].[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Before/After on a 90 hour save[/size]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/fdo7vyv.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Installation[/size]\n<br />[size=2]Use Mod Organizer 2/Nexus Mod Manager/FOMM, or manually extract the .zip file into your Fallout New Vegas 'Data' folder.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Background[/size]\n<br />[size=2]During gameplay, the game maintains 'ActorCause' objects, which track information about the source of projectiles and explosions. These objects contain the source actor, their position, and a list of all actors detecting them at the time the weapon is fired. Due to an oversight in the game's design, the list is not calculated correctly for the player, causing it to grow excessively large over time with potentially thousands of actors. This list is not used in-game, but it is still saved, leading to bloated save files.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]For countless other engine fixes see\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66347]lStewieAl's Tweaks[/url].[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Source[/size]\n<br />[size=2]Available in downloads.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />If you feel like donating:\n<br />[url=https://ko-fi.com/V7V4GEEWW][img]https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi3.png[/img][/url]"
