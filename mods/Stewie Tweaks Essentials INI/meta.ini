nexusDescription="[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66347]Stewie's Tweaks[/url]\xfeff is the biggest &amp; best mod for New Vegas, and it requires a .ini file to get started before you can start customizing your own settings. This is one such .ini file that is meant to be used as a \"starter pack\", with only the tweaks that were selected by Stewie. In short, these are his picks for the options nobody should really want to play without, as they fix bugs and improve quality of life without compromising the balance of the core gameplay.\n<br />\n<br />If you would like to see what's included, check the screenshots or check out the [url=https://rentry.co/ysup8]text version[/url]\xfeff. I've also included a scriptrunner version of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/59638?tab=files]JIP Improved Recipe Menu[/url] in the main file. For those who do not want this, an optional file has been provided as an alternative."
