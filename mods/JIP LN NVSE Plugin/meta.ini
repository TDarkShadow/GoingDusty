nexusDescription="[b][size=3]This mod is an extension to the New Vegas Script Extender (NVSE). It adds 900+ new functions, which can be used in GECK scripting and (in some cases) as conditions.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]As of v40.00, this plugin also includes all the functions from the (now defunct) Lutana NVSE Plugin, made by the venerable LuthienAnarion.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]For a full list and documentation of the new functions, please visit\xa0\xa0[/size][url=https://geckwiki.com/index.php?title=Category:Functions_(JIP)][b][size=3]this page[/size][/b][/url][size=3].[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][size=3]Additionally, this mod includes numerous engine bug fixes/tweaks, and restores several broken game features.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][size=3]Optional game patches (toggle-able via ..&#92;Data&#92;NVSE&#92;Plugins&#92;jip_nvse.ini):[/size][/color]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][size=3][color=#f9cb9c]bIgnoreDTDRFix[/color] - [/size][size=2]Fixes the Ignore DT/DR effect (mostly found in some melee/unarmed weapons), which is completely broken in the game.\xa0In addition, modifies the game's\xa0\x64\x61mage-reduction calculation, such that DT is subtracted BEFORE DR is applied.[/size][/b]\n<br />[/list][/b][b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][size=3][color=#f9cb9c]bEnableFO3Repair[/color] - [/size][size=2]Brings back the FO3-style item repair menu to FNV. The max repair amount of items will be capped to the player's Repair skill. For example, with 75 skill, items can only be repaired for up to 75% of their max health, as opposed to 100% as before, regardless of skill level.[/size][/b]\n<br />[/list][/b][b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][size=3][color=#f9cb9c]bEnableBigGunsSkill[/color] - [/size][size=2]Restores Big Guns as a fully-functional, playable skill.[/size][/b]\n<br />[/list][/b][b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][size=3][color=#f9cb9c]bProjImpactDmgFix[/color] - [/size][size=2]Fixes an engine bug where weapons which fire projectiles that explode upon impact (i.e. Missile Launcher, Grenade Launcher, etc.) would only apply the damage from the explosion, even on direct hit, ignoring the weapon's hit damage.[/size][/b]\n<br />[/list][/b][b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][size=3][color=#f9cb9c]bGameDaysPassedFix[/color] - [/size][size=2]Fixes an engine bug where the 'GameDaysPassed' and 'GameHour' global timers would \"freeze\" and stop increasing in game real-time (they would only increase when sleeping, waiting or fast traveling). This issue directly affected hardcore needs build-up, which would also freeze in game real-time.[/size][/b]\n<br />[/list][/b][b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][size=3][color=#f9cb9c]bHardcoreNeedsFix[/color] - [/size][size=2]Fixes an issue where some hardcore needs could, for undetermined reasons, end up having negative values. This resulted in hardcore needs not increasing at the correct rate/ at all.[/size][/b]\n<br />[/list][/b][b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bNoFailedScriptLocks[/size][/color][size=2] - Fixes an engine behavior where a script that has failed (due to any reason) at some point during execution will be effectively disabled by the game and will no longer be processed again until the game is restarted.[/size][/b]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bDoublePrecision[/size][/color] - Modifies the game's code such that arithmetic/relational operations in scripts are calculated/evaluated with double-precision floating-point accuracy (instead of single-precision). This was causing various issues, where relational operators (==, !=, &lt;=, &lt;, &gt;=, &gt;) were not evaluating correctly, and numeric calculations ended with inaccurate results (this was especially observed with relatively high absolute values). Additionally, this patch also guarantees no script errors/crashes in cases of division by zero.[/b]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bQttSelectShortKeys[/size][/color] -\xa0If enabled, (a)\xa0when selecting an item stack in either the inventory, container, or barter menus, holding SHIFT will transfer/drop the entire stack, whilst\xa0holding CTRL will transfer/drop a single item from the stack - thus skipping the quantity-select menu.\xa0(b) Picking up from a container a stack of items that are weightless (such as ammo on non-hardcore mode) will bring up the quantity-select menu, instead of automatically picking the entire stack.[/b]\n<br />[b]\n<br />[/b][/list][list]\n<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bLocalizedDTDR[/size][/color] - When enabled, a distinction will be made between head-armor and body-armor when applying damage reduction from DR/DT. Head hits will benefit only from DT/DR gained from worn head-armor (if any), whereas body hits, in similar fashion, only from DT/DR gained from worn body-armor. (Note: Requires bIgnoreDTDRFix to be enabled).[/b]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bVoiceModulationFix[/size][/color] - Adds voice modulation (a slight distortion effect) for talking activators and holotapes.[/b]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bSneakBoundingBoxFix[/size][/color] - Fixes a longstanding Bethesda games' bug where the dimensions of the collision bounding box encapsulating the player (as well as all NPCs) remained fixed and did not scale to correspond to body posture. This, effectively, had made it impossible to crawl through breaches and spaces when crouched, despite being able to easily fit through them. This patch fixes this issue for the player character and human companions.[/b]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bEnableNVACAlerts[/size][/color] - If NVAC is installed, enable this setting to receive in-game alerts in the event an exception has occurred in the game's code that was successfully handled by NVAC. You will be notified by a corner message, and the error's details will be printed to the console. This should make it a lot easier to identify the precise circumstances/location in which the error has occurred.[/b]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bLoadScreenFix[/size][/color]\xa0- Forces the load menu to give priority to location-specific load screens (if any are found to match current location) when selecting a load screen to display.[/b]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]bNPCWeaponMods[/size][/color]\xa0-\xa0When enabled, all NPCs will have a chance for their main weapon to include weapon mods. The chance is based on each NPC's level - the higher the level, the greater the chance. The type of mod(s) is selected randomly from the ones available for the particular weapon. Weapons have a chance to include multiple mods, though 2 mods is rare, and a fully-modded weapon is uncommon.[/b]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]uNPCPerks[/size][/color]\xa0-\xa0Unlocks perks for NPCs (perks will no longer be restricted to the player character and player teammates). Script commands such as AddPerk/RemovePerk/HasPerk/etc. will work on ANY NPC in the game. Optionally, perks will automatically be added to human NPCs.[/b]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[color=#00ff00]Game fixes/tweaks (applied by default):[/color]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][size=2]Using the console does not block earning new Steam achievements.[/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=2]The console is fully functional even when a controller is plugged.[/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=2]Disabling controller vibration, either via the Settings Menu, or by setting bGamePadRumble=0 in FalloutPrefs.ini, does what it was supposed to do - completely disable any motor vibrations (this should significantly prolong the life of your batteries).[/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=2]Custom made armor audio templates work properly and are no longer ignored by the game.[/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=2]Calling [i]RemoveMe[/i] from within a [i]OnAdd[/i] block will not cause a CTD when moving a stack of items to the player's inventory from the container/barter menus.[/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=2]The maximum character-count of corner messages is increased from 259 to 515.[/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=2]The character-count limit of perk descriptions, displayed in the trait menu, is increased from 512 to 1024.[/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=2]Vendor names are displayed correctly when first opening the barter menu.[/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=2]The hard-coded grass fade-distance limit of 3,000 is removed.[/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b]Adding a perk for teammates ([i]player.AddPerk PerkID 1[/i]) does not erroneously apply the effects of every entry point multiple times, equal to the current number of teammates.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]The effects of teammate perks are properly applied on teammates upon game load.\xa0[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Medicine/Survival skill bonuses will no longer boost the magnitudes of detrimental effects of medicine/food items.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]The mouse scroll wheel can be used in the quantity prompt menu for (dec-)increasing selected quantity.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Ammo effects are shown in the crafting menus; correct\xa0item value and weight displayed.[/b]\n<br />[*][b][i]Constant[/i]-type global variables retain their values upon exiting to the main menu.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Gun shell-casings' lifetime in 1st person uses the [i]fGunShellLifetime[/i] GMST (as in 3rd person), instead of being capped at 2 seconds.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Moving weapons, which have mods attached, to/from a container (or barter buy/sell) does not make them lose the \"+\" suffix to their names.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Fixes a serious issue in the script parser, silently failing (buffer overflow) if any single script line had a compiled size greater than 72 bytes - a limit that could easily be reached when calling functions which take string arguments.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Fixes a bug where the sun glare texture would no longer be shown when exiting to the world from an interior.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Fixes a bug where pip-boy icons for armour items would always display the male version, regardless of the player character's gender.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Fixes a bug where clouds would sometimes become invisible when exiting from an interior cell.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Fixes a bug where weather high-noon IMODs' fade in/out pattern (as a function of time of day) was inverted.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Replaces the highly unbalanced algorithm by which the game picks music to play from Media Sets defined in Media Location Controllers. Music will now be picked in a proper random order. Moreover, once played, the same music track will not be picked again until every track in the set has been played at least once.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Fixes a bug where dead bodies of actors that were killed while being ragdoll-ed would assume a T-pose when loading a game.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Fixes a bug where GetItemCount would sometimes return a non-zero count for items that are not in fact in the container.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Fixes an issue where ash/goo piles of respawning actors would not get cleared by the game when the parent cell resets, and would thus remain forever.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Fixes a bug where modded weapons, when equipped by NPCs, would use the model of the standard, unmodded variant.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Fixes a bug where disabled furniture objects/idle markers were still \"seen\" and used by actors.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Fixes a bug where kill challenges were incremented when essential actors were knocked unconscious.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Fixes the light setting in projectile forms, which was completely broken.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Fixes an issue where the scripts of crafted items would not run until the item was dropped and picked up again. Note that this was fixed only for armours and non-disposable weapons.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Fixes dialogue combat reactions/comments, all of which were completely broken.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]The 'Swap Impact Data' setting for world spaces was effectively broken, and now works properly.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Replaces the rather faulty algorithm by which the game picks SFX audio files to play from a folder, which was not truly random, was repetitive, and tended to rarely/never pick some of the files.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Placed Acoustic Space primitives were completely broken in the game, and now work as intended.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]Fixes a code error causing Media Location Controllers to not evaluate faction relations correctly, resulting in relation-specific media sets to never be played.[/b]\n<br />[*][b]The vanilla functions GetHitLocation &amp; GetLastHitCritical now work when called from within OnHit and OnHitWith script blocks.[/b]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[color=#00ff00][size=3]Extra features:[/size][/color]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][size=3][color=#f9cb9c]FalloutCustom.ini[/color] [/size][size=2]may now be created in the game's user folder (%USERPROFILE%&#92;Documents&#92;My Games&#92;FalloutNV). Setting entries included in this file will overwrite the values defined in either Fallout.ini or FalloutPrefs.ini. This allows modifying the game's configuration files without actually editing them. This also ensures any INI tweaks will persist and will not be reset/discarded by a mod organizer or the default launcher.[/size][/b]\n<br />[/list][/b][b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][color=#f9cb9c][size=3]Extra fonts[/size][/color][size=2] - Expands the existing 8 font-type slots available in the game by an additional 80 extra slots.
