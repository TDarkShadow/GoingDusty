A new DUST update&#33;?\xa0\r<br />-Bug fixes galore&#33;\r<br />-8 new alternative starts&#33;\r<br />-All weapons have standardized skill requirements. To be used without any sway pistols require 50, rifles require 65, automatics require 75, and scoped weapons require 100. Melee weapons are standardized based on size and whether they are bladed/blunted.\r<br />-The Fort is integrated&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[b]-^THIS IS (probably) DUST&#39;S FINAL VERSION: STAY TUNED FOR DUST&#39;S SUCCESSOR IN FALLOUT 4.\r<br />[/b]\r<br />[size=4][u]Introduction[/u][/size]\r<br />From the very first time I played Fallout: New Vegas, I was disappointed by the atmosphere of the Mojave. Gameplay wise, FNV was a step up from FO3, but the atmosphere was nowhere near as good. The Mojave seemed too... tame. That&#39;s where DUST comes in.\xa0\r<br />[u]\r<br />[size=4]What Is DUST?[/size][/u]\r<br />DUST is a Post-Apocalyptic survival simulator with an emphasis on lore and story. DUST completely overhauls nearly every aspect of the game to better represent an apocalyptic survival-horror atmosphere. Combat, weather, perks, loot, enemies, you name it. Some areas have even been visually overhauled. All vanilla NPCs have either been killed or changed beyond all recognition. You will not be able to complete quests or join factions. There is but one quest in DUST. Stay alive.\xa0\r<br />\r<br />DUST takes place 20 years after the events of New Vegas. As you explore you will slowly learn the story of DUST, but unlike vanilla Fallout, you are not the main character. You are simply a bystander, and must create your own story.\xa0There\xa0[i]is[/i]\xa0one way to win DUST. A true survivor must escape the Mojave. With help from notes and keen observation, one may be able to learn of the exit. Even then, the player will have to go a long way to get out.\xa0\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u]Requirements\r<br />[/u][/size]-v1.6 and before require Dead Money DLC, Honest Hearts DLC, Lonesome Road DLC\r<br />-v1.65 and onward require Dead Money DLC, Honest Hearts DLC, Lonesome Road DLC, Old World Blues DLC, and Gunrunners Arsenal DLC\r<br />-There is no DLC free version of this mod.\r<br />-Alternative Start mods are no longer required (or compatible, apparently). DUST uses its own start.\r<br />-If you have either my &#34;Tribal Fiends&#34; Mod or my &#34;Melee Reach Fixed&#34; mods, you don&#39;t need those, as they are included in this mod.\r<br />[u][size=4]\r<br />Incompatibilities and Load Order[/size]\r<br />[/u]Lots of things, probably. Anything that changes NPCs, anything that changes weather, anything that changes the stats of most weapons and armor. Anything that changes player health, enemy health. Anything that changes gameplay significantly. I&#39;ve balanced DUST to my own liking. If you install other mods that change that balance, you could either end up ruining everything, or vastly improving it to your own liking. That&#39;s up to you. MOST OF THESE WILL STILL WORK AS LONG AS YOU LOAD DUST AFTER THEM IN THE LOAD ORDER. Do I need to bold that? People don&#39;t seem to pick up on that. You DO NOT need to uninstall all of your mods to play DUST. Just load DUST after them, and most of them will still work fine.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u]The Basics[/u][/size]\r<br />[size=3]Don&#39;t Starve[/size]\r<br />Dehydration and starvation rates are now greatly increased. At the same time, available food and water have been greatly diminished in number. Gathering sufficient food and water will now be a struggle. (Hint: Don&#39;t go to bed thirsty. You will die.)\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Don&#39;t Get Shot\xa0[/size]\r<br />Humans (including the player) are now much more susceptible to wounds due to me increasing the damage multiplier on each body part. You may initially curse me when you first get torn apart by a Tunneler, but you&#39;ll thank me when you realize how little ammo you&#39;ll have to shoot with. It is suggested that you use Normal difficulty for DUST.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Don&#39;t Go Insane[/size]\r<br />Murdering people, eating human flesh, and taking hardcore drugs will not do wonders for your mental health. If you&#39;re not careful, you could just go insane. Insane individuals lose 3 Charisma and Intelligence and suffer from debilitating hallucinations and lapses in memory- often waking up somewhere with no memory of how they got there. On the other hand, insane players also have access to unique perks, so it&#39;s not all bad. Be aware, though- once you go insane, you never go back.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Don&#39;t Cry[/size]\r<br />DUST is hard. Really hard. You&#39;re probably gonna die a few times. Strategy is incredibly important if you want to survive. You can&#39;t just run into battle and rely on your compass to tell you who to kill. You&#39;ll need to scope out each situation as it arrives. Craft, crouch, and don&#39;t be obsessed with winning every battle.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u]Atmosphere[/u][/size]\r<br />The atmosphere of the Mojave has been completely redone. Nearly all weather has either been replaced with that of the Divide or edited to have a dusty/polluted feel. All healthy looking desert plants have been replaced with dead counterparts. Oh, and Lake Mead is drained. Actually the entire Colorado River is drained. It&#39;s a Tunneler-infested Labyrinth now. (I am aware of the LOD issues around Mead Canyon, this should be fixed in an update)\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u]Common Enemies[/u][/size]\r<br />[size=3]Tribals[/size]\r<br />Tribals are among the most common human enemies you&#39;ll encounter. These scattered bands tends to lack firepower, using instead a plethora of melee and throwing weapons.\r<br />[size=3]\r<br />Cannibals[/size]\r<br />Cannibals too lack when it comes to high-quality weaponry. Their arsenal is made up mostly of home-made firearms, hacking blades, and explosives. Cannibals usually aren&#39;t seen wandering the wastes and are most often encountered in the ruins of old settlements. Be careful though- these monsters tend to make up for their crappy weaponry in sheer numbers.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Survivors\r<br />[/size]Survivors are people like you. Some are good, some are bad. Most Survivors will shoot on sight, just as you will probably will. Some will stand their ground, only attacking if you invade their personal space. A rare few will actually be willing to trade with you. Survivors are, for the most part, a mixed bag. Some will have extremely high-quality weaponry while others will have crap. Some live in groups, some live alone.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]NCR[/size]\r<br />The NCR are the last major faction to survive. While Caesars Legion, The Great Khans, the Powder Gangers, and many other factions dissolved into innumerable bands of tribals and survivors, the NCR managed to keep hold of a few strongholds. Over the past 20 years, the NCR have learned not to trust the average wastelander, due to their tendency to be cannibalistic madmen. Be careful, the NCR have access to high quality weaponry and often shoot on sight.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Tunnelers\xa0\r<br />[/size]As predicted by Ulysses in Lonesome Road, the Tunnelers of the Divide have migrated over the past 20 years. Few Bighorners or other herbivorous creatures remain due to the hunger of the Tunnelers. Geckos are gone too, because I hate their stupid eyes. I mean, er, because the Tunnelers ate them. Tunnelers are fast, strong, and all over the place. They will kill you.\xa0\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Cloud Victims[/size]\r<br />These mysterious survivors live only in the radioactive ruins of Vegas. Mutation has given them the ability to quickly heal when exposed to radiation.\r<br />[u]\r<br />[size=4]Weapons and Apparel[/size][/u]\r<br />The variety of weapons and apparel have been greatly increased. Fight with dozens of new homemade weapons and armor as well as repurposed Unique and DLC items scattered throughout enemy levelled lists. I&#39;ve also thrown some weapon modifications into the levelled lists since they can&#39;t be bought anymore. These are very rare, though. Most weapons and apparel you come across will be in terrible condition. Be aware though- your carry weight has been drastically reduced, so you won&#39;t be able to carry around an arsenal with you at all times. One or two guns, maybe a melee too if you&#39;ve got light armor. Wearing no armor at all (just regular clothing) actually has an advantage now, since it weighs so little.\r<br />[u]\r<br />[size=4]Scarcity[/size]\r<br />[/u]Ammo is very rare. Most ammo you find will be junk rounds. Food and water is very rare. And before you get any ideas, no you can&#39;t just drink out of one of the many faucets of New Vegas. Plumbing doesn&#39;t work in the apocalypse (what? shocking&#33;). You can still drink the brown sludge in the bottom of toilets, though. If you so choose, you can eliminate hunger as a threat by turning cannibal. Cannibalism is treated as an addiction, however, and will result in some penalties. Meds and other loot are also very rare.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u]Recommended Mods[/u]\xa0(Not required, but fun to use with DUST)\r<br />[/size][size=3]General Mods[/size]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/54107/?]NPCs Travel[/url]\xa0\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/43834/?]No Second Chances\xa0\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/57446/?]STUN[/url]\xa0(Very useful if you don&#39;t want to play as an insane murderer all the time)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/40593/?]Project Ultimatum\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/51777/]Cover Based Stealth[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/54916/?]Digital Nightmare[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/48126/?]\r<br />Better New Vegas[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/53890/?]New Vegas Post Apocalyptic[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/38049/?]Wasteland Defense[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/36922/?]Real Time Settler[/url]\xa0(Hardcore version incompatible)\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/55696/?]Apocalyptic Mojave[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/56786/?]Combined Weapons\xa0\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/39968/?]Flashlight NVSE\xa0\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/39670/?]Mojave Sandstorm[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/59097/?]Spooky Vegas Radio[/url]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]DUST Add-Ons-\xa0[/size]These mods were made specifically to be used with DUST, so be sure to check them out&#33;\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62218/?]DUST - Begin Again by Vera Keyes Main Menu theme replacer[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/60538/?]DUST Alternative Theme - Insanity[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58753/?]Understone[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58165/?]Private Property Expired[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58963/?]DUST ENB\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/59333/?]Melancholy Dust ENB\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/59543/?]Menu and Loading Screen Replacer - Melancholy DUST ENB\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/60179/?]Mojave Sandstorms- DUST Edition[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58971/?]Alternative DUST Theme\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58978/?]TTW DUSTy Mods\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/60018/?]DUST Compatibility Patches[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/60120/?]DUST LOD[/url]\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/60216/?]DUST Player\xa0[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/60216/?]Home\r<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/59015/?]\r<br />[/url][u][size=4]Known B[/size][/u][u][size=4]ugs and Incompatibilities\r<br />[/size][/u][size=3]Alternative Start Conflicts[/size]\r<br />-White Screen at start- Alternative Start and DUST are no longer completely compatible. To use both, install Alternative Start and begin a new game before activating DUST.\r<br />-Invincible NCR Ranger- Caused by choosing the NCR start from Alternative Start. If you really want to use the NCR start, you can remove the Ranger by opening the console, clicking him, and typing &#34;disable&#34;.\r<br />[size=3]-[/size]Fast Travel Works&#33;?- Put DUST at the bottom of your load order.\xa0\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Project Nevada Conflicts\r<br />[/size]Project Nevada&#39;s Core plugin works fine.\r<br />-The Rebalance plugin is highly incompatible and will overwrite a LOT of DUST&#39;s gameplay changes. DO NOT USE IT.\xa0\r<br />-The Cybernetics plugin will only work if you have a mod that adds doctors to install your cybernetics.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Alternative Weapon Damage Mods[/size]\r<br />Are not necessary&#33; DUST has its own version that is balanced to work with the rarity of weapons/ammo. Using another mod will break this, and can make your game either harder or easier, depending on different enemies. I do not recommend using them.\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Miscellaneous Bugs\r<br />[/size]-Hardcore needs spiking after reloading save.\r<br />   -This is a known vanilla bug accentuated by DUST&#39;s increased rates. Luckily, it only happens once- after your first reload. Simply toggle hardcore   \xa0mode off and back on again and you should be good to go for the rest of your playthrough.\r<br />-Seams and gaps in the Big MT water.\xa0\r<br />-Tribals taking a vow of silence.\r<br />-NCR Heavy Trooper at 188 has Veronica dialogue.\r<br />-Respawning NCR Ranger after Vault 34 Completed- Caused by choosing to help the NCR during the quest in the Vault. Use the &#39;disable&#39; console command to remove the Ranger.\r<br />[u][size=4]\r<br />DOWN THE ROAD\r<br />[/size][/u]DUST is mostly finished. I may be releasing a few more bug fixing updates, but no more major updates are planned. There will be a DUST for Fallout 4.\r<br />\r<br />[size=4][u]ATTENTION MODDERS\r<br />[/u][/size]Like DUST? Feel free to mod it yourself&#33; In the optional files I have included an esm version of DUST for you to use as a master file&#33; By wiping out quests and the like, I&#39;ve left the Mojave a bit of a blank slate for you. Feel free to upload any DUST based mods you make. Just be sure to credit the original (and it may not be a bad idea to ask the permission of some of the modders listed below if you alter any of their contributions to DUST).\r<br />[u]\r<br />[/u][size=4][u]Many Credits to These Wonderful Modders[/u]\r<br />[/size]Ninjanub107- Voice Actor- Sewer Broadcast.\xa0\r<br />Fawkes1243- Writer\r<br />AngryBananaStudios- Writer\r<br />theflummox- Writer\r<br />DerVampir- Writer\r<br />Michael13117- Writer\r<br />Jiveo- Modeller (Bone Weapons, Makeshift Incinerator)\r<br />BobSwaget12345678913- Modeller (Auto-Material Rifle)\r<br />\r<br />Shoeburglar- Wastelander Pack (http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/57912/?)\r<br />Eddur- Homemade Weapons (http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/41099/?)\r<br />TheRiff- Cut Raider Graffiti (http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/47508/?)\r<br />nekronorm12- Ghoul Mask (http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/46685/?)\r<br />ahseph- Backpacks (http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/39503/?)\r<br />djabend- Junk Weapons, grenades (http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/39438/?)\r<br />Zeus_II- Seeker Armor, Vagrant Armor, Opportunist Armor (http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/43760/?)\r<br />the_mango55- Homemade Grenades (http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/37672/?)\r<br />dragbody- Awesome Cannibal Face Textures (http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/53529/?)\r<br />Dakcenturi- Custom Start Resource (http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/37390/?)\r<br />\r<br />Special thanks to PinballJoe and DasOmega for helping bug test DUST.
